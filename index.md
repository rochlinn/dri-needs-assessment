## Executive Summary

From May 17th - June 12, 2021, UBC Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and the UBC Library from both Vancouver and Okanagan Campuses launched a survey to investigate UBC researchersâ€™ needs in 25 distinct areas relating to data, software, and computational training and support (see full details of survey in Appendix X.), receiving 241 total responses.  Following the survey, three focus groups were conducted with UBC researchers to gain additional insights in these areas.

## Definitions

**Training** Single workshops, workshop series, online modules/videos, and formal courses

**Support** Web resources, consultations, advising, troubleshooting, and recommendations

## Key Findings

1. A significant portion of respondents reported wanting training and support, but didn't know they were available
2. For services sought within UBC, many turned to a mix of different departments and units, resulting in overlapping service providers
3. Participants in focus groups noted that finding the right services is challenging, and a centralized portal would be beneficial

## Recommendations

These findings suggest that

* Awareness of training and supports could be enhanced;
* Collaborative efforts at addressing DRI supports and training across units and departments could offer a more seamless and informed delivery of DRI supports and training.

## Reports

The 25 areas of DRI queried have been split into 4 individual reports, detailing if supports and training were needed and where they were sought. Each report is catered to a specific unit and represents core areas of service delivery within each of those units.
