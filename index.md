## Executive Summary

From May 17th - June 12, 2021, UBC Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and the UBC Library from both Vancouver and Okanagan Campuses launched a survey to investigate UBC researchers’ needs in 25 distinct areas relating to data, software, and computational training and support (see full details of survey in Appendix X.), receiving 241 total responses.  Following the survey, three focus groups were conducted with UBC researchers to gain additional insights in these areas.

Training was defined as: single workshops, workshop series, online modules/videos, and formal courses
Support was define as: web resources, consultations, advising, troubleshooting, and recommendations

This report will only focus on those areas in which UBC ARC was sought for training or support.

## Key Findings

The majority of researchers wanted training and support but didn’t know they were available (Figure X)
Training and support relevant to ARC is also sought from several other units (Figure X)
Participants in focus groups noted that finding the right service is challenging, and a centralized portal would be beneficial 

## Recommendations

Coordinate communications with other portfolios, faculties, and departments, to ensure that all researchers who want a service know it exists and where to find it
Coordinate services with other portfolios and groups who provide similar services, to maximize efforts and reduce duplication
Coordinate with other portfolios and groups to build a central portal to discover services
