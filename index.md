## Executive Summary

Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) refers to a suite of services that enables the collection, processing, dissemination and disposition of research data. This includes strategies for planning, organizing, storing, sharing, computing, and ultimately archiving or destroying one’s research data.

From May 17th - June 12, 2021, UBC Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and the UBC Library from both Vancouver and Okanagan Campuses launched the DRI Needs Assessment Survey to investigate UBC researchers’ needs in 25 distinct areas relating to DRI (see full details of survey [insert link]), receiving 241 total responses.  Following the survey, three focus groups were conducted with UBC researchers to gain additional insights in these areas.

## Definitions

**Training** Single workshops, workshop series, online modules/videos, and formal courses

**Support** Web resources, consultations, advising, troubleshooting, and recommendations

## Key Findings

1. A significant portion of respondents reported wanting training and support, but didn't know they were available;
2. For services sought within UBC, many turned to a mix of different departments and units, with several overlapping service providers;
3. Participants in focus groups noted that finding the right service is challenging, and a centralized portal would be beneficial.

## Recommendations

Based on these findings, recommendations are to:

1. **Coordinate and strategize communications** across portfolios and departments to ensure that researchers are able to easily find and access services;
2. **Coordinate and strategize training and support** across porfolios and departments that offer similar/overlapping services, to maximize efforts and reduce duplication;
3. **Coordinate and develop a unified portal** as a centralized entry point to DRI services.
